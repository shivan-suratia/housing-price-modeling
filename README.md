# Housing Price Modeling Project

This was a project for CS210, Computer Architecture. 

This program takes 2 text files of matrices containing housing attributes (1 for training, 1 for testing). Linear regression is done from scratch using linear algebra row operations to make predictions on housing prices from the test data set.
